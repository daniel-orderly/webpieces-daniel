    <h3>Domain Specific Routes</h3>
    Most WebApps will not have Domain Specific Routes.  This is for special situations.  If there is no match on
    any domains, the router skips to the next section looking for a match.  If there is a match on a domain, the router
    narrows to only matching here in this section
        <ul>
        #{list items:domains, as:'domain'}#
            <li>${domain.domain}$</li>
        #{/list}#
        #{else}#
            <li>You have no domain specific routes that match only on domain</li>
        #{/else}#
        </ul>
    
    <h3 id="routes">Non Domain Routes</h3>
    <p>Webpieces divides url paths up into scopes for speed.  It looks up scope in a Map first and then loops over each route
    in that scopes list doing a Pattern match (so it's good to use scopes to keep code organized and LESS pattern matching).
    Static routes are not shown yet below but we always match on them last since they will be cached.  Not that you would
    have 3000 routes but if you did, you can organize into scopes so that each loop is only 10-30 things instead of looping
    and matching with java's Pattern object 3000 times for the worst case.</p>
    
    You are trying to match on any of these patterns...
    <ul>
        #{list items:paths, as:'path'}#
            <li style="color:red;">${path}$</li>
        #{/list}#        
    </ul>
