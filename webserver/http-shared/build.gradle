    //This was a tough decision as I really liked http-router not depending on http2 nor http1.1.  If it is going to depend on
    //one of those, we pick http2 meaning if you want an http1 only server, you will drag http2 along with the router if you re-use it :(
    //BUT then again, everyone is going to be upgrading to http2 over time anyways ;)

	//DO NOT DEPEND ON HTTP1.1 NOR HTTP2 here!!!!!
	//this keeps us pluggable with ANY http parser implementation...lost the battle there :(
    //Feature trumps this desire
