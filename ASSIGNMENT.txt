ASSIGNMENT #1 - The assignment here is that the DataWrapperGenerator has an issue.  If you chain, then split, then chain, then split
and you keep doing that, you end up never releasing memory for the first byte array that comes in.  This is what we
call a memory leak in that memory is not released like we would like.  

We need to fix that.  

ASSIGNMENT #2 - implement ByteBufferDataWrapper with tests

ASSIGNMENT #3 - implement response parsing on branch assignment/ImplementResponseParsing

ASSIGNMENT #4 - implement Async server on branch assignment/implementAsyncServerProject
