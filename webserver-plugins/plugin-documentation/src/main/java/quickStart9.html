<h2>Server.java Walkthrough</h2>

<p>When you start up DevelopmentServer.java, most changes to your web application will not require a restart.  Because
    webpieces is a library, however, changes to the 3 classes that startup webpieces would require a restart and they are</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/Server.java">Server.java</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/ServerConfig.java">ServerConfig.java</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/WebSSLFactory.java">WebSSLFactory.java</a></li>
</ol>

<p>YOU own these classes now to modify to your heart's content.  Any changes to these classes or classes
    that these depend on would require a development server restart to see the changes. Luckily, these
    classes pretty much do not really need to ever be touched.</p>

<p>Looking closer at Server.java, you will notice 3 different configurations</p>

<ol>
    <li>WebServerConfig</li>
    <li>RouterConfig</li>
    <li>TemplateConfig</li>
</ol>

<p>Each config object configures that piece of the webserver making it easier to trace what different configurations do
    as well as keep each piece separate from each other.</p>

<p>We have a firm belief that nearly all properties should be in the database and not on the filesystem including
    configuration properties.  We generate Server.java such that you could modify it and put any properties
    you like on the filesystem but we advise against 99% of properties there as typically you want property file
    changes to go through your test team rather than someone getting on a production server and tweaking a property.
    Of course, the 1 property that must be a command line argument or a property is the database connection such that
    your server can exist in multiple environments like development, staging, and production with different database
    connections.  Then if you really need to be able to change a setting/property, we also believe it belongs in
the database as well not in a properties file on the filesystem.</p>

<p>To make it simpler for all components/plugins to read/write properties into a database, an interface SimpleStorage.java
    is provided.  The generated application implements this interface connecting it to hibernate but you could change it
    to connect to some noSQL database or whatever else you would like.  The current implementation generated is
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/base/libs/SimpleStorageImpl.java">SimpleStorageImpl.java</a>.
You know own that code as well and can swap it out to a noSQL database or anything you like.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: In the future, we want to add a bean plugin that exposes MBeans to a web gui for you and also
    saves changes to the database thereby eliminating the need for property files for basically everything. It would
    do the following for you...</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>expose a web page dynamically to modify those properties(for one node or for all machines)</li>
    <li>read in the properties from SimpleStorage on startup to set them back to what they were</li>
    <li>write changes from the web page into the database so they are persisted</li>
</ol>

<p>This automatically managed way of doing properties is preferred over using property files</p>

<h2>A walkthrough of Meta & Modules & Plugins</h2>

<p>Server.java defines a metaFile variable pointing to myhelloworld-all/myhelloworld/src/main/resources/appmeta.txt.
DevelopmentServer.java defines a metaFile variable pointing to myhelloworld-all/myhelloworld/src/main/resources/appmetadev.txt.
Each of these files has a String pointing to the main Meta class bootstrap for your webapp.  This file is also the
cutpoint of recompiling so that if this file changes, or the meta it points to changes and so on, all that code can
recompile(in DevelopmentServer only though).  In production, everything is pre-compiled and ready for speed.</p>

<p>If you look closely, you will notice the appmeta-dev.txt contains
    <a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample-dev/src/main/java/org/webpieces/meta/DeveloperMeta.java">DeveloperMeta.java</a>
    and in that file, he just re-uses all
    the production meta stuff as well as adding 2 plugins that are only in the development server.  After all, we don't
    want to expose a SQL GUI nor webpieces documentation on our production website.</p>

<p>Next, looking at MyHelloWorldMeta.java file, you will notice it is broken down into 3 main components</p>

<ol>
    <li>list of Guice Modules</li>
    <li>list of Route Modules</li>
    <li>list of Plugins</li>
</ol>

<p>I won't go in depth on plugins at this point but just note that plugins can be another fully contained web
    application with it's own guice modules, route modules, controllers, and html pages.  This allows you to plugin
    full webapplications into your webapplication.  It's what we use for all the backend plugins that could be removed
    if you desire a really thin lightweight server</p>

<p>Let's next look at the Server.java constructor which is critical and very intentional:</p>

<pre><code>*[public Server(
    Module platformOverrides,
    Module appOverrides,
    ServerConfig svrConfig
) {]*</code></pre>

<p>If you are familiar with Guice, webpieces creates one injector to create the webpieces webserver and a
completely different injector to create all your controllers and classes that you write.  The platformOverrides
passed into the Server constructor are for 2 things</p>

<ol>
    <li>For the DevelopmentServer to swap in some specific development code that doesn't run in production</li>
    <li>For testing so tests can swap out specific pieces to wire up the test</li>
</ol>

<p>The appOverrides is mainly for test purposes allowing you to swap out ANY class on your stack created
by Guice no matter how deep it is in your stack of code.  This is how we typically swap out remote clients for
a mock client for instance.  Lastly, the ServerConfig exposes just enough configuration allowing tests
to bind to port 0 so tests can run in parallel and things like that.</p>

<p>Using platformOverrides, you can actually swap out nearly any class in webpieces BUT</p>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility - Voltaire, no Uncle Ben from spider man did not say it first!</p>

<p>Ok, that was lame, but whatever, hack away!!!!</p>
