<h3>Documentation Plugin</h3>

<p>Well, you are using this plugin if you are reading this text right now!!! and the url is
http://somedomain.com/@documentation.  This plugin runs in the DevelopmentServer by default
though nothing is preventing you from removing it from there and adding it to production
for the world to see ;).</p>
