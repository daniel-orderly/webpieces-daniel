<h3 id="logback">SLF4J/Logback</h3>

<p>Have you ever brought a 3rd party jar in that is logging to log4j and you are logging to the jdk or vice versa.  You
probably never even checked what logging libraries your 3rd party jars use and so those logging statements
including errors and warnings just go to the void.  To prevent this issue, SLF4J was created along with logback.
logback is one implementation of SLF4J.</p>

<p>To configure it correctly, we currently have not tested out the exclusions of log4j jar that need to be done
and the inclusions of the log4j adapters but the 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18952479/how-to-exclude-multiple-slf4j-bindings-to-log4j">exclusion is documented</a>
and for the jars to include, you will want to follow the top left picture on the 
<a href="https://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html">SLF4J legacy page</a></p>

<p>If you manage to test it all out with a 3rd party that logs to log4j, let me know and I will update the template
so it generates the gradle code to exclude and include the correct jars</p>

<p>LASTLY and of big note, we have configured the logback.xml such that it logs in red for warnings/errors. </p>

<p>Then on top of that to be really cool, we also log the class and line number  of where the log statement is
defined for easy traceability</p>

<p>The location of the production logback.xml file is in {yourproject}-all/{yourproject}/src/dist/config/logback.xml.
This file is zipped up and ends up on the filesystem so you can tweak it on a running server and the server re-reads
it in every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>The location of the development server logback.xml file is in {yourproject}-all/{yourproject}-dev/src/main/resources/logback.xml</p>

<h3 id="log4jdbc">log4jdbc</h3>

<p>We also install log4jdbc so you can see every SQL statement being issues to your database.  This allows you 
to see 1+N query issues and convert your query to a simple join so it only hits the database once 
instead.  The logging levels are configured in logback.xml for this.  See the above section for the
locatios of logback.xml for production and development if you want to tweak the log levels of
log4jdbc</p>

<h3 id="codeCoverage">Test Code Coverage</h3>

<p>The generated template not only has gradle but already has checkstyle already installed for
you.  This way, you can run your tests and click around to see what lines of code are not
yet covered by tests.  No spending tons of time trying to set it up yourself.  We know you
always want to and put it off so we did it for you.  Just run ./gradlew build to run
all your tests.  Then you can open up 
{yourproject}-all/{yourproject}/output/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html to view your results.</p>

<h3 id="checkstyle">Checkstyle</h3>

<p>Checkstyle can be ANNOYING as F if you are true strict on the rules so please don't do that to your
team.  Perfect is the enemy of good enough and yet I see developers strive for perfect.  If you want
perfect, go build a formatter/fixer that fixes imports for me not one that breaks the build if I have
unused imports.  That just wastes my time on something that is not important and slows down the 
business as a whole because some developer has OCD and can't shake it.</p>

<p>So, we install checkstyle rules that turn out to keep your code much cleaner like the following(though
you can delete any rule you don't like):</p>

<ol>
    <li>Methods can't be more than 70 lines(yes, don't make huge methods)</li>
    <li>Classes can't be more than 700 lines(stop creating HUGE classes)</li>
    <li>Protect against anti arrow pattern.  nesting only allowed to level of 2(create another method instead)</li>
    <li>Don't allow fetch=eager attribute on JPA(see my hibernate plugin for reasons why)</li>
    <li>ensure if there is equals, there is also a hashcode</li>
</ol>

<p>Checkout checkstyle and add more rules if you like but I think the base set is a great starter.</p>

<h3 id="backpressure">Backpressure</h3>

<p>One of the most fun and hard to get right features.  Webpieces can perform like a beast from this feature.
We literally stop reading from a socket if the upstream controllers are not completing enough features or
methods.  calling future.completedValue(someValue) literally acts as an ack which will ack the http request
then the next layer will ack the number of bytes for that message and then through the SSL layer, it will ack
again the number of SSL bytes next.  Finally, if there are too many bytes outstanding, it not only stops 
reading that socket (backpressuring that client), but it literally will wait until more bytes than usual is
acked to prevent jitter of turning on/off the socket all the time.  It literally waits for the server
to be ahead of the game and ready to go.</p>

<p>This feature is wired through each layer.  This is really stolen from the audio world and voice over IP
and the idea of a jitter buffer.  Basically, if you have a queue of 1000, you only start sending audio to
the phone when we have 500 audio packets and then if we ever reach 0, we stop sending audio to phone
until it hits 500 again.  Similarly, if we hit 1000, we are at the edge so to get rid of turning on/off
all the time, we immediately drop 500 packets.</p>

<p>In the case of webpieces, if we hit 0, we do nothing, but if we max out at 1000 so to speak, we turn
off the socket until it is back down near 500 and the server is ready to crank again.</p>

<p>It ended up this caused performance gains in the nio library itself which was quite interesting
when we were playing around with performance testing.</p>

<h3 id="compression">Eager Compression</h3>

<p>Nowadays most browsers ask for the same list of compressions.  On server startup, we see if any static files
have changed and if they have, we compress and add them to our compressed files cache.  Then, when we get requests
for static files, we just send them the compressed version so we don't waste time compressing files when 
requests come in.</p>

<h3 id="caching">Force Browsers to cache mis</h3>

<p>If you use the correct tags, we generate a query param on the url like ?hash=somelonghash.  If you change your
*.js file or *.css file, then this hash changes and the browser will automatically cache miss when looking for
this new js file.  Many webservers, you have to remember to change the url or version of the file name.  Instead
we allow humans to not even care.  It just works so we set cache times to 1 year knowing any new or 
edited file will be a cache miss and will get it from our webserver</p>

<h3 id="overrides">Override any webpieces class</h3>

<p>Webpieces is written statelessly such that every class of business logic is intended to be a Singleton.  There
are a couple of exceptions to that.  When you start a webpieces server like so:</p>

<pre><code>*[Server server = new Server(platformOverrides, null, new ServerConfig("production"));]*</code></pre>

<p>The platformOverrides contains any binding to any class you want to override in the whole platform.  If you
were ever frustrated about modifying a platform, putting in a quick hack to fix a bug, fear not as we just
made that issue pretty much go away.  Swap in your class for an immediate fix rewriting even the private 
methods that may have contained the bug</p>

<p>Yes, this is customization to the extreme.  Did you expect anything less from me?  Have fun in this
playground!</p>

<p>Lastly, if you saw the webpieces design page, you can see how you can easily build your own webserver 
replacing the webpieces router OR the templating engine OR the frontend.  Everything is basically a 
self-contained piece meant to be re-used and had fun with.</p>
