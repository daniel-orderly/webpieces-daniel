<h3>Backend Plugin</h3>

<p>Welcome to a pluggable plugin...lol.  Go figure.  Well, the reason is in testing, you generally 
want to disable all plugins so the backend is a plugin in itself.  The Backend Plugin is targeted
for production use so you can have a backend with an IT login such that you can manage the server
with other backend plugins.  </p>

<p>This plugin serves two purposes:</p>

<ol>
    <ul>To provide secure urls and a login page</ul>
    <ul>To provide a plugin point for a menu system for all backend plugins</ul>
</ol>

<p>Now, some backend plugins are only plugged into the DevelopmentServer for development
while others are for production use. The full list of plugins and their intentions is found
here:</p>
