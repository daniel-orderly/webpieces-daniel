<h2>Your first Hibernate entity</h2>

<p>Ideally however in a dynamic web application, we would like to let people persist data for a later time and
modify that data.  A Hibernate plugin is installed by default for rapid prototyping though you can remove the
hibernate plugin from the build files if you desire and use something else.  In the meantime, welcome to
our first hibernate entity bean</p>

<pre>
<code>package org.webpieces.helloworld.myapp;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.NamedQueries;
import javax.persistence.NamedQuery;
import javax.persistence.NoResultException;
import javax.persistence.Query;
import javax.persistence.SequenceGenerator;
import javax.persistence.Table;

//NOTE: More can be found in the hibernate documenation
//This tells hibernate this is an entity bean and will be stored
@Entity
//@Table informs hibernate of more details on the table such as name
@Table(name="CAR")
//@NamedQueries is where we define queries we will make into the database
@NamedQueries({
	//For more info on the query language, see the hibernate HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
	//for details
	@NamedQuery(name = "findByName", query = "select u from CarDbo as u where u.name = :name"),
})
public class CarDbo {

	//@Id tell hibernate this is the primary key
	@Id
	//This annotation says grab 10 ids at a time in memory on this host so we don't hit the database on every create row to
	//populate the id.  The name needs to match the generator below.  It is good idea to always rename these so be
	//careful of cut/paste
	@SequenceGenerator(name="car_id_gen",sequenceName="car_sequence" ,initialValue=1,allocationSize=10)
	//This tells hibernate to just generate the ids in sequence
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.SEQUENCE,generator="car_id_gen")
	private Integer id; //You almost always want to use Integer over int and Long over long so it can be null so you can tell if it has been persisted

	//Use @Column to further define the column like forcing it to be unique
	@Column(unique = true)
	private String name;

	private String style;

	public Integer getId() {
		return id;
	}

	public void setId(Integer id) {
		this.id = id;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public String getStyle() {
		return style;
	}

	public void setStyle(String style) {
		this.style = style;
	}

    //This method re-uses the @NamedQuery we defined above
	public static CarDbo findByName(EntityManager mgr, String name) {
		Query query = mgr.createNamedQuery("findByName");
		query.setParameter("name", name);
		try {
			return (CarDbo) query.getSingleResult();
		} catch (NoResultException e) {
			return null;
		}
	}
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Next, let's add our RouteIds for displaying a page to create a car, displaying a page to edit a car and
finally for actually posting a car to the database</p>

<pre>
<code>package org.webpieces.helloworld.myapp;

import org.webpieces.router.api.routing.RouteId;

public enum MyMainRouteId implements RouteId {
	HELLO_WORLD, DYNAMIC_HELLO_WORLD,
	GET_CREATE_CAR_PAGE, GET_EDIT_CAR_PAGE, POST_CAR
}</code>
</pre>

<p>Then, let's add our new routes for the route ids we just added</p>

<pre>
<code>package org.webpieces.helloworld.myapp;

import org.webpieces.ctx.api.HttpMethod;
import org.webpieces.router.api.routing.AbstractRoutes;

public class MyMainRoutes extends AbstractRoutes {
	@Override
	protected void configure() {
		addRoute(HttpMethod.GET ,   "/helloworld",        "MyMainController.helloWorld", MyMainRouteId.HELLO_WORLD);
		addRoute(HttpMethod.GET ,   "/helloworld/{name}/{id}", "MyMainController.dynamicHelloWorld", MyMainRouteId.DYNAMIC_HELLO_WORLD);

		//route to render the page of creating a new user
		addRoute(HttpMethod.GET ,   "/car/new",         "MyMainController.carAddEdit", MyMainRouteId.GET_CREATE_CAR_PAGE);
		//route to render the page of editing an existing user
		addRoute(HttpMethod.GET ,   "/car/edit/{name}", "MyMainController.carAddEdit", MyMainRouteId.GET_EDIT_CAR_PAGE);
		//route to save a new or existing user
		addRoute(HttpMethod.POST,   "/car/post",        "MyMainController.postSaveCar", MyMainRouteId.POST_CAR);

	}
}</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that here we call carAddEdit for both creating a car and editing one.  If someone types in
http://localhost:8080/car/new, then the name variable will equal null when calling carAddEdit method telling us it is
a brand new car.  Next, let's add the carAddEdit method to our controller</p>

<pre>
<code>	public Action carAddEdit(String name) {
		if(name == null) {
			return Actions.renderThis("entity", new CarDbo());
		}

		CarDbo car = CarDbo.findByName(Em.get(), name);
		if(car == null)
			throw new NotFoundException("car does not exist");
		return Actions.renderThis("entity", car);
	}</code>
</pre>

<p>and add a page called carAddEdit.html that will be rendered as well</p>

<pre>
<code>*[<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>

#{form action:@[POST_CAR]@, class:'form-horizontal', style:'min-width:500px;max-width:800px;margin: 0 auto'}#
	<h4 id="myModalLabel"> Car </h4>

	*{optional in case this is the add operation and so this is used in case of edits only }*
	<input type="hidden" name="entity.id" value="${optional('entity')?.id}$"/>
	#{field 'entity.name',   label:'Name'}#<input type="text" name="${field.name}$" value="${field.flashOrValue}$" class="input-xlarge">#{/field}#
   	#{field 'entity.style', label:'Style'}#<input type="text" name="${field.name}$" value="${field.flashOrValue}$" class="input-xlarge">#{/field}#

   	<input type="submit" name="submit" value="&{'Save', 'link.save'}&" class="btn btn-primary" />

#{/form}#

    </body>
</html>]*</code>
</pre>

<p>*[Ok, so there is a lot going on here that we need to explain.  The first tag #{form}# will generate the form html
for you with the correct url.  Any params like class and style are converted as well into the final form html element.
	The *{ }* is how you 'always' should comment in templates.  Rather than use html commenting style, using *{ }*
	will prevent tags from running in your html.  An html comment will not do this.  Then there is a hidden input
	which will have the id of the element if it is being edited.  This allows us to re-use the same html and java
	controller code for adds and edits(quite nice).  Next, we have the #{field}# tags which do a ton of work under the
	covers so you can style every field in every location of your application consistently with where the error for
	that field goes, tooltip help and even i18n stuff.  Lastly, the #{field}# tag also helps with not blowing away
	what the user typed in when the page refreshes due to errors so you don't do extra work for that either.
	Now that this is all setup, as long as you did not stop your development server, go to
	http://localhost:8080/car/new and you should see a small form on the page with
	a save button that will not work and will return a 5XX when you click it.  Click the save button, and then
	look at your logs and scroll up to the logs in red(YES YES!! errors and warnings are in red so they are damn
	easy to find and are typically very detailed as to what is wrong!).  If you stopped your development
	server however, it will not startup since there is a route with a method that does not exist.  Either way,
	we need to fix the POST of the Car so let's do that next.  Add the following method to the controller]*
</p>

<pre>
<code>	public Redirect postSaveCar(CarDbo entity) {
		if(entity.getName() == null) {
			Current.validation().addError("entity.name", "name is required");
		} else if(entity.getName().length() < 3) {
			Current.validation().addError("entity.name", "name not long enough");
		}

		if(entity.getStyle() == null) {
			Current.validation().addError("entity.style", "style is required");
		} else if(entity.getStyle().length() < 3) {
			Current.validation().addError("entity.style", "style not long enough");
		}

		//all errors are grouped and now if there are errors redirect AND fill in
		//the form with what the user typed in along with errors
		//we redirect so the back button always works
		if(Current.validation().hasErrors()) {
			FlashAndRedirect redirect = new FlashAndRedirect(Current.getContext(), "Errors in form below");
			redirect.setIdFieldAndValue("id", entity.getId());
			return Actions.redirectFlashAll(
					MyMainRouteId.GET_CREATE_CAR_PAGE, MyMainRouteId.GET_EDIT_CAR_PAGE, redirect);
		}

		Current.flash().setMessage("User successfully saved");
		Current.flash().keep();

		Em.get().merge(entity);
        Em.get().flush();

		return Actions.redirect(MyMainRouteId.HELLO_WORLD);
	}</code>
</pre>

<p>We first validate each thing we need to and keep adding errors to each field that is wrong.  Then, we check if validation
	hasErrors() and if it does, we redirect back to the edit or add page depending on if we are editing or adding the
	entity.  If there are no errors, we process to call Em.get().merge(entity) will save or update the CarDbo in
	our database.  Em.get().flush() ensures all changes are persisted such that you can call persist, delete and then at
	the end if you discover some sort of validation went wrong, don't flush and none of it will be saved.</p>

<p>Follow these next steps exactly so we can demonstrate some real power of details.  To test out validation,
type in http://localhost8080/car/new and do NOT type anything in and hit save.  Errors
now popup.  Next, type in 's' and 't' in each field and save.  Different Errors popup. Next, enter 'ferrari' for the
name, and enter 'junker' for the style and hit save and we end up on the Hello World page.
Finally, hit the back button and look at your data and hit back button again and look at the s
and t data.  Each step is saved because we force you to follow the PRG pattern.  The back button is never broken
in webpieces.  You will never see this image for a webpieces app</p>

<img src="%[/org/webpieces/plugins/documentation/resubmit_chrome.png]%"/>

<p>Next, let's use the @db plugin to view the in-memory database.  Go to http://localhost:8080/@db and for
the JDBC URL, change it to 'jdbc:h2:mem:test' so it hits the in-memory database.  All other settings are
fine.  Then click
the Connect button.  Click on the 'CAR' table which inserts a select statement in the GUI and then click 'Run'.
Now, all rows in the table are shown, which in this case is the single row with ferrari.</p>

<p>Lastly, let's test out updating our ferrari so go to http://localhost:8080/car/edit/ferrari and you can then
update your ferrari and re-query the database</p>

<p>Next, try http://localhost:8080/car/edit/notexist and we will see that we get the Development only NotFound page.</p>

<p>Now, this example was very crude(CRUDe?) so instead let's now give you a complete CRUD example with listing
entities and everything and how little code is required in webpieces to do such a thing.  Not only that, this is
the defacto pattern such that code generation can be added to a development plugin</p>

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="@[QUICK_START4]@" role="button">Next Basic CRUD</a>
