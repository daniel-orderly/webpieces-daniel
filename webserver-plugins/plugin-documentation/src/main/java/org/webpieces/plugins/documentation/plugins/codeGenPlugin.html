<p><b>Does not exist just yet but will ROCK!!!</b></p>

<p>Now that we demonstrated how easy it is to create html CRUD pages and ajax CRUD pages, it would
be very easy to implement a wizard to generate that code with the last step being the developer
manually modify his XXXXMeta.java file to add in the CRUDRoutes.java file that we generate.  We
will generate XXXXCRUDRoutes.java, XXXCRUDController.java and the html files and the XXXDbo.java
entity bean as well.  All the developer has left to do then is modify XXXMeta.java to add
the XXXXCRUDRoutes to it and done.  This would make making CRUD real fast</p>
