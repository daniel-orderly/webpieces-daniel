<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>

<p><b>You will want to read this page in it's entirety</b></p>

<p>Routing is about taking the request and calling the correct method on the Controller along with any parameters from the
request.  For an http POST request, the Router will convert all the form parameters into an array of javabeans to be passed
into the action method of the Controller.  For an http GET request like /client/deanhiller where deanhiller is the name of
the client, the Router will pass the url query parameters to the action method of the Controller(in this case, just the single 
'deanhiller' is passed)</p>

<p>All RouteModules are defined and returned in the method getRouteModules in the Meta file.  As an example, there is a 
legacy project we have to upgrade if we ever break compatibility with webapps(you can also look at this projects commit logs
to figure out how to upgrade your project).  The Meta file is 
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/base/WebpiecesExampleMeta.java">WebpiecesExampleMeta.java</a>.
In this file, you can see an AppRoutes module, a LoginRoutes module, etc.</p>

<p>Lastly, in 
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/base/WebpiecesExampleMeta.java">WebpiecesExampleMeta.java</a>
you will also see a getPlugins method.  Some of these plugins return their own RouteModules with their own routes as well</p>

<h2 id="routingSyntax">Route Module Syntax</h2>

<p>Using 
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/base/AppRoutes.java">AppRoutes.java</a>
as an example of a no scope Route Module
</p>

<pre>
<code>addRoute(GET, "/user/{name}", "examples/ExamplesController.loadUser", ExamplesRouteId.LOAD_USER);</code>
</pre>

<p>When a GET request comes in with url /user/deanhiller, ExamplesController.loadUser(String name) will be called passing
in 'deanhiller' as the name.  The following methods are supported</p>

<ol>
    <li>GET</li>
    <li>POST</li>
    <li>PUT</li>
    <li>DELETE</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="uriPattern">The URI Pattern</h4>

<p>The URI pattern defines the route’s request path. Some parts of the 
request path can be dynamic. Any dynamic part must be specified within braces {…}.</p>

<pre>
<code>/clients/all</code>
</pre>

<p>exactly matches:</p>

<pre>
<code>/clients/all</code>
</pre>

<p>but</p> 

<pre>
<code>/clients/{id}</code>
</pre>

<p>matches both:</p>

<pre>
<code>/clients/1234
/clients/dean</code>
</pre>

<p>A URI pattern may have more than one dynamic part:</p>

<pre>
<code>/clients/{id}/accounts/{accountId}</code>
</pre>

<p>Any valid regular expression can be used for the URI</p>

<p><b>Dynamic parts are named. The Controller's method has variables of the same name such that the router passes the info to the method</b></p>

<p>By default, the trailing URL slash is important.  For example, this route

<pre>
<code>addRoute(GET, "/clients", "SomeController.load", ExamplesRouteId.LOAD);</code>
</pre>

<p>will match the <b>/clients</b> URL but not <b>/clients/</b>. You can tell the Router
that you want to match both URLs by adding a question mark 
after the trailing slash(after all, it's a regular expression). For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>addRoute(GET, "/clients/?", "SomeController.load", ExamplesRouteId.LOAD);</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="actionMethod">Java Call Definition</h4>

<p>The next piece of the route definition is the action method the router will invoke as in</p>

<pre>
<code>"SomeController.load"</code>
</pre>

<p>There are three ways to define the Controller and method.  The first is relative reference from 
the RouteModule file to the actual Controller</p>

<pre>
<code>"../examples/ExamplesController.index"</code>
</pre>

<p>This allows each package to have a RouteModule along with many Controllers</p>

<p>The second method is an absolute path from the root of the classpath as in</p>

<pre>
<code>"/org/webpieces/base/examples/ExamplesController.index"</code>
</pre>

<p>The last method may read the best however it does not support relative references 
and is always an absolute path on the classpath but we leave
the choice up to you</p>

<pre>
<code>"org.webpieces.base.examples.ExamplesController.index"</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="routeids">RouteId</h4>

<p>By now, you have an understanding on how an http request comes in, it will be matched to the URI pattern 
and the Controller will be invoked.  Let's say however, the page has some html like so</p> 

<pre>
<code>&lt;a href="/clients"&gt;Link to other page in my app&lt;/a&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>Let's further say, you have many many pages that have this same link in them.  If we ever want to change the url
from <b>/clients</b> to <b>/users</b>, we now have to go through and find and change many many references perhaps
breaking the application as well where some locations we forget to change.  To avoid this, there are RouteIds so
instead of the above code, this is how we link to another page</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;a href="@ [LOAD]@"&gt;Clients Page&lt;/a&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>Then, when this page is rendered, the route id will be reversed to</p> 

<pre>
<code>&lt;a href="/clients"&gt;Clients Page&lt;/a&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>Let's say you have a more complicated route</p>

<pre>
<code>addRoute(GET ,   "/user/edit/{id}",   "crud/CrudUserController.userAddEdit", EDIT_ROUTE);</code>
</pre>

<p>In this case, you pass in the id as well as the route id so the url can be formed so this would be your html code</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;a href="@ [GET_EDIT_USER_FORM, id:entity.id]@""&gt;Go to User $ {entity.name}$&lt;/a&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>Each plugin and RouteModule gets to define it's own enum for RouteIds as long as that enum extends RouteId.  This means
that conflicts can ensue when two RouteIds have the exact same name.  Let's say we have <b>PluginRouteId.LOAD</b> and
<b>MyRouteId.LOAD</b>.  In this case, the following code will fail the build forcing you to fix this issue

<pre>
<code>&lt;a href="@ [LOAD]@"&gt;Clients Page&lt;/a&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>So instead, you must qualify it further as in</p> 

<pre>
<code>&lt;a href="@ [MyRouteId.LOAD]@"&gt;Clients Page&lt;/a&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>If there is still a conflict as perhaps a plugin named it's route enum file MyRouteId as well, then you can specify the
fully qualified package though personally I would just rename my RouteId enum file</p>

<h4 id="domainScope">Domain Specific Routes</h4>

<p>Up to this point, if a request comes in for http://domain1.com/clients or http://domain2.com/clients, the domain is
completely ignored.  For most web applications, this is fine.  Let's say however you want to server N domains on
1 webserver all with the same routes and just using the domain as a key into the database.  Then let's further say
you want 'one' specific domain to have it's own routes like your backend administration or signup web application and
we will call this domain http://mybusiness.com.  In this case, you will use a special class ScopedDomainRoutes passing
in all the routes that are only for that one domain like so</p>

<pre>
<code>Routes domainModule = new ScopedDomainRoutes("mybusiness.com", 
    new Domain1Routes(),
    new MoreRoutes()
);</code>
</pre>
        
<p>Now, all the routes in Domain1Routes and in MoreRoutes will only be matched when requests are coming in for the domain
mybusiness.com.  All other requests for domain1.com and domain2.com will only match routes in the other modules not
defined here</p>

<h4 id="httpsRoutes">Http vs. Https Routes</h4>

<p>Up until this point, we have been defining http routes and 100% of http routes are served over http AND https.  The reason
for this is two fold</p>

<ol>
    <li>Chrome only does http2 over https</li>
    <li>There is really no performance impact on modern day servers since the connection is left open for many requests</li>
</ol>

<p>Https routes on the other hand are only served over https.  One way of defining https routes is to call getScopedRouter</p>

<pre>
<code>Router httpsRouter = router.getScopedRouter(null, true);
httpsRouter.addRoute(GET , "/secureRoute",         "HttpsController.home", HttpsRouteId.HOME);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, /secureRoute will only be served over https.  A second method is to extend <b>ScopedRoutes</b> and 
implement the isHttpsOnlyRoutes like so</p>        

<pre>
<code>@Override
protected boolean isHttpsOnlyRoutes() {
    return true;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>Any routes defined in this file will all only be served over https now</p>

<h4 id="staticFiles">Static File Routes</h4>

<p>Again, using 
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/base/AppRoutes.java">AppRoutes.java</a>
as an example, a static directory of resources can be defined like so
</p>

<pre>
<code>addStaticDir("/assets/", "public/", false);</code>
</pre>

<p>On the filesystem, the directory in the project must be public and the url of the resource will be translated.  For example,
a request for <b>http://domain.com/assets/somedir/somepic.jpg</b> is translated to <b>public/somedir/somepic.jpg</b>.
Thankfully, {yourproject}-all/{yourproject}/src/dist/public ends up in the correct location when you deploy so the above line
is all that you should need for static files.  You can add more though if you like.  The false tells webpieces it is not
on the classpath and is on the filesystem.  All files on the filesystem that are text are precompressed for sending to the
browser so we don't have to compress on demand and use CPU.  We put these pre-compressed files in a cache.  If you
have just one file, that can be done as well like so(though I am not convinced this is ever needed)</p>

<pre>
<code>addStaticFile("/favicon.ico", "public/favicon.ico", false);</code>
</pre>

<p>Finally and this is for plugins mostly, you can have resources on the classpath.  Plugins are distributed as a single
jar so they must include their resources in that jar.  Notice that it has to be an absolute path for classpath resources.
Also of note to prevent conflicts, we use a java like directory structure for the plugin</p>

<pre>
<code>baseRouter.addStaticDir("/org/webpieces/plugins/documentation/", "/org/webpieces/plugins/documentation/", true);</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="specialRoutes">NotFound Route and InternalError Route</h4>

<p>As shown in  
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/base/AppRoutes.java">AppRoutes.java</a>
there needs to be a route for when a page is not found like so
</p>

<pre>
<code>setPageNotFoundRoute("examples/ExamplesController.notFound");</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that the development server displays a very special page showing all routes and showing the production page in an iframe
so you still know what it does in production.  This route can only be set by ONE RouteModule and applies to all pages.  Similarly,
the internal error route also can only be defined once and is done like so</p>

<pre>
<code>setInternalErrorRoute("examples/ExamplesController.internalError");</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="scopedRoutes">Scoped Routes</h4>

<p>You can further divide routes into groups of scoped routes like so</p>

<pre>
<code>Router scope1 = router.getScopedRouter("/backend", false);
Router scope2 = router.getScopedRouter("users", false);
scope2.addRoute(GET , "/list",         "HttpsController.home", HttpsRouteId.HOME);</code>
</pre>

<p>Above, if a request comes in for /backend/users/list, the route is matched.  If a request for /list comes in,
not found will be displayed as /list is only found in the scopes that were setup.  Webpieces always tries to
find a scoped router first and loop through those matches first before falling back to the global no scoped
router.</p>

<h4 id="order">Process of Matching URI</h4>

<p>The order of matching URI's is best explained by running the DevelopmentServer and hitting a page that
does not exist which will then display this page(only in development server is this shown, not in production).  As
you can see below, the Domain Specific Routes are listed first.  If a Domain matches and there is no routes that
match in that domain, there is no fallback and a page not found will be displayed.  Each domain router has it's
own not found route.  Continued below the image..</p>

<img src="%[/org/webpieces/plugins/documentation/notFound.png]%"/>

<p>Let's say a request comes in for GET /secure/crud/something/blah, the first router will lookup a scoped router
'secure' and then that router will try to find a scoped router 'crud' and that router will try to find a router
'something'.  These are all O(1) lookups on a HashMap so they are very quick.  Since it does not find a scoped 
router called 'something', it then loops through all the routes in the 'crud' router trying to find a match.  If it
finds none, it falls back to the 'secure' router and loops through his routes if any and finally falls back to 
the global routes looking for a match.  If none is found, the not found route is displayed</p>
