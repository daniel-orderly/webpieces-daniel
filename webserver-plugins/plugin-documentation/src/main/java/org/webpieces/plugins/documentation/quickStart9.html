<h2>Server.java Walkthrough</h2>

<p>Last updated: May 2nd, 2020</p>

<p>When you start up DevelopmentServer.java, most changes to your web application will not require a restart.  Because
    webpieces is a library, however, changes to this one class and any classes referenced from this class classes that 
    would require a restart</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/Server.java">Server.java</a></li>
</ol>

<p>YOU own this class now to modify to your heart's content.  Any changes to this class or classes
    that these depend on would require a development server restart to see the changes. Luckily, these
    classes pretty much do not really need to ever be touched except in extreme server customization
    OR you can swap platform classes to fix a bug (instead of forking a git repo which is a PITA to do
    that AND try to rebuild all the jars, deliver them somewhere...fuck all that shit!! save time and swap
    out the platform class that has the bug yourself...please do report though so we can fix it)</p>

<p>Next navigate into WebpiecesServer.java and look at the meat of the constructor. You will notice 3 different configurations</p>

<ol>
    <li>WebServerConfig</li>
    <li>RouterConfig</li>
    <li>TemplateConfig</li>
</ol>

<p>Each config object configures that piece of the webserver making it easier to trace what different configurations do.
As a side note, you can copy this class and modify to your hearts content as well.  It used to be generated for you
actually and only sits on top of webpieces apis.  We decided to own a default version of this class</p>

<p>To make it simpler for all components/plugins to read/write properties into a database, an interface SimpleStorage.java
    is provided.  The generated application implements this interface connecting it to hibernate but you could change it
    to connect to some noSQL database or microservice or whatever else you would like.  The current implementation generated is
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample/src/main/java/org/webpieces/service/SimpleStorageImpl.java">SimpleStorageImpl.java</a>.
You now own that code as well and can swap it out to a noSQL database or anything you like.</p>

<p><b>The properties plugin -</b>In the backend(see documentation on backend), there is now a plugin where you can take any
Guice injected class in your app and extend ****Managed.java.  The plugin detects that and creates a backend webpage so
you can change the properties of your bean from the webpage. <b>Not only that</b>, but it saves changes to the database
and on restart, the properties are re-applied before the server goes live.  This method tends to leave the old school
way of using property files in the dust</p>

<h2>A walkthrough of Meta & Modules & Plugins</h2>

<p>Server.java defines a metaFile variable pointing to myhelloworld-all/myhelloworld/src/main/resources/appmeta.txt.
DevelopmentServer.java defines a metaFile variable pointing to myhelloworld-all/myhelloworld/src/main/resources/appmetadev.txt.
Each of these files has a String pointing to the main Meta class bootstrap for your webapp.  This file is also the
cutpoint of recompiling so that if this file changes, or the meta it points to changes and so on, all that code can
recompile(in DevelopmentServer only though).  In production, everything is pre-compiled and ready for speed. 
Production is kept clean with no classloading tricks that DevelopmentServer has on purpose.</p>

<p>If you look closely, you will notice the appmeta-dev.txt contains
    <a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all/blob/master/webpiecesexample-dev/src/main/java/org/webpieces/meta/DevServerMeta.java">DevServerMeta.java</a>
    and in that file, he just re-uses all
    the production meta stuff as well as adding a few plugins that are only in the development server.  After all, we don't
    want to expose an SQL GUI nor webpieces documentation on our production website.</p>

<p>Next, looking at ProdServerMeta.java file, you will notice it is broken down into 3 main components</p>

<ol>
    <li>list of Guice Modules</li>
    <li>list of Route Modules</li>
    <li>list of Plugins</li>
</ol>

<p>I won't go in depth on plugins at this point but just note that plugins can be another fully contained web
    application with it's own guice modules, route modules, controllers, and html pages.  This allows you to plugin
    full webapplications into your webapplication.  It's what we use for all the backend plugins that could be removed
    if you desire a really thin lightweight server</p>

<p>Let's next look at the Server.java constructor which is critical and very intentional:</p>

<pre><code>*[public Server(
    Module platformOverrides,
    Module appOverrides,
    ServerConfig svrConfig,
    String ... args
) {]*</code></pre>

<p>If you are familiar with Guice, webpieces creates one injector to create the webpieces webserver and a
completely different injector to create all your controllers and classes that you write.  The platformOverrides
passed into the Server constructor are for 2 things</p>

<ol>
    <li>For the DevelopmentServer to swap in some specific development code that doesn't run in production</li>
    <li>Rapid Bug fixing as you can swap most classes(including private methods) out and in with your bug fix</li>    
</ol>

<p>The appOverrides is mainly for test purposes and staging environments allowing you to swap out ANY class on your stack created
by Guice no matter how deep it is in your stack of code.  This is how we typically swap out remote clients for
a mock client for instance. </p>

<p>Using platformOverrides, you can actually swap out nearly any class in webpieces BUT</p>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility - Voltaire  (no, Uncle Ben from spider man did not say it first!)</p>

<p>Ok, that was lame, but whatever, hack away!!!!</p>
