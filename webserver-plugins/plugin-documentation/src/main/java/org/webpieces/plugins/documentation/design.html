</ol>

Webpieces is designed such that EVERYTHING is a library including the main webserver.  Here is a full picture of the dependencies between
the most important jar files.

<img src="%[/org/webpieces/plugins/documentation/webpiecesDesign.jpg]%"/>

Notice that http-webserver really only depends on 3 things to create the webserver

<ol>
   <li>http-frontend2 - By using this library, you deal with http messages and stop dealing with sockets.  This is the only piece you need if you want to create a micro-webserver</li>
   <li>http-router - The http-webserver listends to http-frontend2 and translates/feeds requests into http-router</li>
   <li>http-templating - The http-templating is responsible for rending html templates when the webserver tells it to</li>
</ol>

Notice that any one of these pieces could be taken to build another webserver.  http-router actually knows nothing about http
and only knows of a RouterRequest keeping it independet of protocol.  http-webserver is the glue between these 3 main pieces of
the webserver.  

Of course, digging deeper, http2-frontend2 depends on even more pieces and in fact some of those pieces are what are used to
build the http-client that is independent of the http-webserver.
