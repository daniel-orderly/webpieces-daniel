<h3>Jackson Plugin</h3>

<p>For those server exposing json apis, this is the plugin for you.  It even allows all your NotFound
routes under a certain path to return json as well with the 404 instead of the typical webservers
these days that return html to a json client(which seems pretty lame).  This plugin makes use
of the webpieces BodyContentBinder extension point to take bodies and convert them from json
to a bean and convert beans to json to make your controllers just communicate in the form
of java beans or Maps.</p>
