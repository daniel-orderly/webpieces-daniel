<h3 id="useQuery">@UseQuery Annotation</h3>

<p>This really goes under the hibernate plugin as this annotation lives there and is only used with
hibernate.  Let's say you are editing a car on an html form and have the method</p>

<pre><code>*[public Action postEditedCar(CarDbo car)]*</code></pre>

<p>By default, the hibernate plugin will lookup the CarDbo by it's id without joining or
anything.  On top of that, if you use hibernate in it's KISS form, it tends to never break
so here are the rules for KISS form in hibernate:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Make every *ToOne relationship lazy ALWAYS. JPA fucked that up while hibernate annotations did that</li>
    <li>Never ever...ever use cascading persists</li>
</ol>

<p>The reasons for the first one is that it keeps hibernate KISS and you use HQL to eagerly fetch on a
per use-case query.  Some queries may need eager fetches and some won't.  Don't default all queries to 
eagerly fetch EVER.  <b>For this reason, we not only have installed checkstyle but added a rule
in {yourproject}-all/config/checkstyle.xml so that we break the build if someone has an eagerly
fetch on *ToOne relationship</b></p>

<p>On the second point, yes, you may need to persist stuff yourself more, but you will thank me later
for a ton less bugs and complexity.  IMHO, hmmm, humble, fuck that, IMO, hibernate should delete
all those feature and ignore the JPA eager default and never have eager.  The more KISS it is, the
less bugs hibernate would have</p>

<p>Now, back to UseQuery.  This identifies a JPA query that we will use to lookup the entity for you
giving you a chance to do some joins of other tables that you want as well.  Since we install log4jdbc
for you, you can inspect all the SQL being run to make sure there are no 1+N queries going on and 
if there are, you can use the @UseQuery annotation to fix that.  So as an example, you can have this
method naming a JPA named query:</p>

<pre><code>*[public Action postEditedCar(@UseQuery("lookupCarWithJoin") CarDbo car)]*</code></pre>
