<h2>Your first Test or 4</h2>

<p>First, if you haven't read the twitter blog
<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2017/the-testing-renaissance.html">Feature Testing</a>,
we highly suggest reading that!  There are 4 types of testing with Webpieces</p>

<ol>
    <li>Feature Testing library mode</li>
    <li>Feature Testing Remote Client mode</li>
    <li>Feature Testing Selenium</li>
    <li>Component/Unit Testing(which we support better than most platforms but warn you against doing so)</li>
</ol>

<p>In all modes, we typically use an in-memory database to be able to test out writing with production
code and then reading back with production code preventing integration issues that get missed when
you test them in isolation.  We also have this all setup for you unless you are going to use noSQL
in which case you will need to setup your own in-memory version of a noSQL database which is
typically just a Map of Map of Maps and very easy to setup.  In the case of cassandra, like so</p>

<ol>
    <li>First Map is tableName to 2nd Map</li>
    <li>The second Map is row key to 3rd Map</li>
    <li>The third Map is SortedMap of column name to column value</li>
</ol>

<p>BOOOM!!!! In-memory cassandra which we coded that on one project very quickly though you do
need to use a SortedMap on the last map since columns are in-order!!!  I need to revive
<a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/playorm">PlayOrm</a>and rename it as well to some sort
of noSQL mapping layer name that is much like hibernate but scalable and more KISS keeping many
features of hibernate out on purpose to keep ou complexity which keeps out bugs more.</p>

<h4>Feature Testing Library Mode</h4>

<p>This is a great mode in that with a little swapping of things via guice bindings, we put your http
client directly on top of the webserver router and templating engine.  This means you can step directly
from test into the platform bypassing the socket layer unlike Feature Testing Remote Client mode which
goes over a socket.
</p>

<p>We give you a great cheat in that you can copy TestLesson2Html.java so copy this file and
edit it to remove all the tests and remote endpoints.  TestLesson2Html demonstrates how to swap
out remote clients deep within your code with mocks to create a feature test with
mock remote systems.  Here is our copied and modified file TestHelloWorld.java:</p>

<pre><code>*[package org.webpieces.helloworld;

public class TestHelloWorld extends AbstractWebpiecesTest {

	private JdbcApi jdbc = JdbcFactory.create(JdbcConstants.jdbcUrl, JdbcConstants.jdbcUser, JdbcConstants.jdbcPassword);

	private HttpSocket http11Socket;
	private static String pUnit = HibernatePlugin.PERSISTENCE_TEST_UNIT;

	@Before
	public void setUp() throws InterruptedException, ClassNotFoundException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException {
		//clear in-memory database
		jdbc.dropAllTablesFromDatabase();

		Server webserver = new Server(getOverrides(false), null, new ServerConfig(pUnit, JavaCache.getCacheLocation()));
		webserver.start();
		http11Socket = connectHttp(false, webserver.getUnderlyingHttpChannel().getLocalAddress());
	}

	@Test
	public void testDynamicHelloWorld() {
		HttpFullRequest req = createRequest("/helloworld/deano/555");

		CompletableFuture<HttpFullResponse> respFuture = http11Socket.send(req);

		ResponseWrapper response = ResponseExtract.waitResponseAndWrap(respFuture);
		response.assertStatusCode(KnownStatusCode.HTTP_200_OK);
		response.assertContains("Hello deano.  Your id is 555");
	}

	public static HttpFullRequest createRequest(String uri) {
		HttpRequestLine requestLine = new HttpRequestLine();
        requestLine.setMethod(KnownHttpMethod.GET);
		requestLine.setUri(new HttpUri(uri));
		HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
		req.setRequestLine(requestLine );
		req.addHeader(new Header(KnownHeaderName.HOST, "yourdomain.com"));

		HttpFullRequest fullReq = new HttpFullRequest(req, null);
		return fullReq;
	}

}]*</code></pre>

<p>The setup is quite simple, drop all tables, then create the production server with some certain
platform overrides(this is where we swap stuff for testing).  We then call webserver.start and
then create a simulated socket(it looks like a socket but isn't and sits on top of the webserver
directly).   The setup is very simple.</p>

<p>Next in the test, we simply create an http request object for a GET request to
"/helloworld/deano/555" and then send it, get the response and verify it is 200 OK and
that the html contains what we expected</p>

<h4>Feature Testing Remote Client mode</h4>

<p>You ready to be blow completely away!!!  Just modify the setup method changing both locations
of 'false' into isRemoteClientMode and add boolean isRemoteClientMode = true; like so:</p>

<pre><code>*[@Before
public void setUp() throws InterruptedException, ClassNotFoundException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException {
    //clear in-memory database
    jdbc.dropAllTablesFromDatabase();

    boolean isRemoteClientMode = true;

    Server webserver = new Server(getOverrides(isRemoteClientMode), null, new ServerConfig(pUnit, JavaCache.getCacheLocation()));
    webserver.start();
    http11Socket = connectHttp(isRemoteClientMode, webserver.getUnderlyingHttpChannel().getLocalAddress());
}]*</code></pre>

<p>Under the covers, we bind to port 0 picking up the available port and then query for the http and https ports
so we can connect the client to the same port allowing you to run many of these test in parallel even since
they connect to different ports.</p>

<li>Feature Testing Selenium</li>

<p>Selenium can be a double edged sword but can work really really well in some cases.  There is already
an example in TestLesson5WithSelenium.java where you can see how we get the ports the webserver bound
to and feed those into the urls for selenium to test properly</p>

<p>You may even be able to get selenium tests to run in parallel if it can open different windows for
testing since we can run our webserver on multiple ports at the same time as well</p>

<li>Component/Unit Testing(which we support better than most platforms but warn you against doing so)</li>

<p>Ok, we do advise against this type of testing as it will limit your refactoring and keeping your
design up to date.  We fine the more unit testing there is, the more people are afraid to refactor
because they have to rewrite the test suite meaning "THERE WILL BE BUGS" they introduce.  The other
form of testing doesn't necessarily catch everything but it catches way more in our experience.</p>
