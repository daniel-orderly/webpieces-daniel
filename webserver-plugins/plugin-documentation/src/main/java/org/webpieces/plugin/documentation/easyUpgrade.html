<h2>Upgrading Webpieces</h2>

<p>Since webpieces webserver is a library first, upgrading is a simple matter of changing the version
in TWO locations.  In your {project}-all/build.gradle file you will see these comments and version:</p>

<pre><code>*[ext {

    //Modify here AND gradle webieces plugin version in file
    // webpiecesexample/build.gradle

    //This version ACTUALLY works with what the git commit says it works with!!!
    webpiecesVersion = '1.9.110']*</code></pre>
    
<p>Simply change the 1.9.110 to the new version which will grab all the new jars.  Next as the comment
above says, change your {yourproject}-all/{yourproject}/build.gradle file in the buildscript section
to the new version as well:</p>

<pre><code>*[buildscript {
    repositories {
       mavenCentral()
       //For testing and to be removed...
       maven {
         url uri('/tmp/myRepo/')
       }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.webpieces:gradle-plugin-htmlcompiler:1.9.110'
    }
}]*</code></pre>

<h2>Next, get help on Upgrading</h2>

<p>We maintain a legacy example project <a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpiecesexample-all">Webpiecesexample-all</a>
and in that project, for any upgrades, if we need to change code, all the examples are there and we tag it for which
upgrade it was for.  This gives you an easy path forward of how to move forward if and when apis change</p>
