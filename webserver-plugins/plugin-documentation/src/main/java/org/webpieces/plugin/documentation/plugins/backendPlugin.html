<h3>Backend Plugin</h3>

<p>Welcome to a pluggable plugin...lol.  Go figure.  Well, the reason is in testing, you generally 
want to disable all plugins so the backend is a plugin in itself.  The Backend Plugin is targeted
for production use so you can have a backend with an IT login such that you can manage the server
with other backend plugins.  </p>

<p>This plugin serves two purposes:</p>

<ol>
    <ul>To provide secure urls and a login page for secure backend plugins</ul>
    <ul>To provide a plugin point for a menu system for all backend plugins</ul>
</ol>

<p>Some plugins are public and show up in the menu system without logging in.  Other plugins
are secure and will require you to login before they show up in the menus</p>

<p>Now, some backend plugins are only plugged into the DevelopmentServer for development
while others are for production use. The full list of plugins and their intentions is found
here:</p>

<p>This Backend Plugin creates yet another extension point that only exists if the backend plugin is 
installed.  If so, yet again, just like webpieces extension points, you use a guice multibinder to 
wire into this plugin like so:</p>

<pre><code>*[Multibinder<BackendGuiDescriptor> backendBinder = Multibinder.newSetBinder(binder(), BackendGuiDescriptor.class);
backendBinder.addBinding().to(InstallSslCertGuiDescriptor.class);]*</code></pre>

<p>This gives this plugin just enough information to wire in the menu system which in this case adds the
InstallSsl Plugin to the menus</p>
