<h1>Creating the Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Last updated: May 13th, 2020</p>

<p>A very simple tutorial, that will just help you to learn the Webpieces library 
with the famous ‘Hello World’ example.</p>

<p>We have split the tutorial into several parts.  Each part will introduce more complex features, and provide
everything that a real project needs: validation, error handling, an automated test suite.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Webpieces requires that you have a working installation of jdk11 or greater.  We do not require intellij or eclipse
but highly recommend one of those as your editors.</p>  

<p>We will assume you already have knowledge of Java and Web development(especially HTML, CSS).  However,
you don't need to have any knowledge of JEE components except a little knowledge in JPA can help.  Webpieces
is a 'full stack' Java framework.</p>  

<p>A solid understanding of one of these two things can help</p>

<ul>
    <li>Guice</li>
    <li>@javax.inject annotations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing Webpieces</h2>

<p>Hah!!!  Since Webpieces webserver is a library, there is no installation as you just depend on it like
a normal maven artifact!  However, because we don't want everyone that uses webpieces to have to create
all the build files that builds a production server, we supply a createProject script that can be run.  It generates
a project with gradle build files that work out of the box along with a main Server class that you can
modify to your heart's desire.  Obviously, you could completely swap out the build system if you desire.  I will 
warn you however though, some systems like maven are rigid and you may start pulling your hair out</p>

<p>To start, download the zip that can create a shell project for you that uses the webpieces library following
these steps</p>

<ol>
    <li>Download the release(https://github.com/deanhiller/webpieces/releases)</li>
    <li>unzip the file you downloaded</li>
    <li>run ./createProject.sh</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: Type these steps in exactly if you want to be able to cut/paste code from this tutorial</li>
    <li>For the camel case app name, enter 'MyHelloWorld'</li>
    <li>For the package, enter org.webpieces.helloworld</li>
    <li>For the directory, enter '..'</li>
    <li>cd ../myhelloworld-all</li>
    <li>./gradlew build</li>
</ol>

<p> At this point, your build should have been successful and all tests are passing as we provide some example tests.
Next, we want to create a production release in the form of a zip file with the logging config, html files, and jar files.</p>

<ol>    
    <li>./gradlew assembleDist #creates the actual webserver distribution zip and tar files</li>
    <li>cd myhelloworld-all/myhelloworld/output/distributions/</li>
    <li>unzip myhelloworld.zip which is your whole webserver</li>
    <li>./bin/{project} to start the production webserver</li>
    <li>In a browser go to http://localhost:8080</li>
</ol>

<p>Here, you will hit the main webpieces webpage with examples that you can click through and use tweak/copy, etc.  Eventually,
you will just delete all the example code.  Next, when you unzipped the zip file, you may have seen 4 directories.  
Now, if you look there are 6 directories which are</p>

<dl>
    <dt>bin</dt>
    <dd>Where your startup scripts are located(we created these for you but you own main so you can create new ones)</dd>
    <dt>config</dt>
    <dd>Where any config files reside, currently only the logback.xml for logging config exists here</dd>
    <dt>lib</dt>
    <dd>All jar files exist here</dd>
    <dt>logs</dt>
    <dd>The generated directory where all log files will be put from logback unless you reconfigure logback.xml</dd>
    <dt>public</dt>
    <dd>The location for all *.jpg, *.css, *.js and all static resources</dd>
    <dt>webpiecesCache</dt>
    <dd>Webpieces pre-compresses text resources on startup to send to browsers to avoid on-demand compression speeding up performance over low bandwidth connections</dd> 
</dl>

<p>Next, view the section in the <a href="https://github.com/deanhiller/webpieces">README on github</a> on 
Eclipse Setup or Intellij Setup.</p>

<p>We mine as well do all the examples while the development server is running so shutdown the previous production server (ctrl-C).
Follow the instructions for your IDE setup above.  <b>Then start the DevelopmentServer.java and keep it running</b>.  Also, while it's 
running, you can view these instructions at http://localhost:8080/@documentation</p>

<h4>To be 'very' clear.  You SHOULD run the Development Server for the whole tutorial without restarting.  I even run my server
overnight and develop the next day</h4>

<p>There is built in documentation at http://localhost:8080/@documentation when running the development server.  The production
server above does not have this so you will want to run the development server in intellij or eclipse.  This is because the
documentation plugin is only installed on the development server.  You could install it on the production server if you
really wanted to(and just make sure to uninstall from the dev server so there is not a conflict of both installing the same
plugin)</p>

<h2>Your first RouteModule</h2>

<p>Now, that you have the beginnings of a webpieces webapp, let's add a new RouteModule. In the project
helloworld-all/helloworld/src/main/java/org.webpieces.helloworld/web, create a package called "myapp" where we
    will put all the helloworld code.  In that package, create a java file called MyRouteId.java like so:</p>

<pre>
<code>package org.webpieces.helloworld.web.myapp;

import org.webpieces.router.api.routes.RouteId;

public enum MyRouteId implements RouteId {
    HELLO_WORLD
}</code>
</pre>

<p>This is where we will put all the RouteIds for this package and for this RouteModule. Notice that the enum must extend
    RouteId as webpieces only knows about RouteId and not your specific enum.  Next, let's use the RouteId and create a
RouteModule class in the same myapp package called "MyMainRoutes" with a single route to our new webpage.</p>


<pre>
<code>package org.webpieces.helloworld.web.myapp;

import org.webpieces.ctx.api.HttpMethod;
import org.webpieces.router.api.routes.Port;
import org.webpieces.router.api.routes.Routes;
import org.webpieces.router.api.routebldr.DomainRouteBuilder;
import org.webpieces.router.api.routebldr.RouteBuilder;

public class MyMainRoutes implements Routes {

    @Override
    public void configure(DomainRouteBuilder bldr) {
        RouteBuilder b = bldr.getAllDomainsRouteBuilder();

        b.addRoute(Port.BOTH, HttpMethod.GET, "/helloworld", "MyMainController.helloWorld", MyRouteId.HELLO_WORLD);
    }
}</code>
</pre>

<p>Here, we are saying when the browser calls any of these urls that end up on our server, webpieces will invoke
MyMainController.helloWorld.  <b>This won't work just YET!</b>.  We need to implement controller first</p>

<ol>
    <li>http://localhost:8080/helloworld</li>
    <li>https://localhost:8080/helloworld</li>
    <li>http://anydomain.com/helloworld  #As long as your DNS is setup properly and we receive the request</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice we used the getAllDomainsRouteBuilder which means these routes apply to all domains EXCEPT domains created
with bldr.getDomainScopedRouteBuilder(String domain) which is a more advanced topic. If you have DNS domainX.com and
domainY.com all pointing to your ip with this server, then domainX.com/hello and domainY.com/hello end up calling
the same controller. Now that we defined a route and a Controller and method to invoke, we should create the Controller
and name it "MyMainController."</p>

<pre>
<code>package org.webpieces.helloworld.web.myapp;

import javax.inject.Singleton;
import org.webpieces.router.api.controller.actions.Action;
import org.webpieces.router.api.controller.actions.Actions;

@Singleton
public class MyMainController {
    public Action helloWorld() {
        return Actions.renderThis();
    }
}</code>
</pre>

<p>Lastly, Actions.renderThis() informs webpieces to render the html file with the same name as the method helloWorld so
next create a file called helloWorld.html in the same myapp directory as the Controller</p>

<pre>
<code>*[<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        Hello World
    </body>
</html>]*</code>
</pre>

<p>Finally, the one last step is we need to tell webpieces about this RouteModule that we created. Inside the class
ProdServerMeta.java (org.webpieces.helloworld.base), modify it to ADD the line "new MyMainRoutes()"
    to the list of RouteModules already defined. Your new
getRouteModules method should look like so (the addition in bold):</p>

<pre>
<code>*[@Override
public List<Routes> getRouteModules() {
    return Lists.newArrayList(
            new LoginRoutes("/org/webpieces/helloworld/web/login/AppLoginController", "/secure/.*", "password"),
            new CrudRoutes(),
            new AjaxCrudRoutes(),
            new JsonRoutes(),
            <b>new MyMainRoutes()</b>
            );
}]*</code>
</pre>

<p>A big note is that all the modules here should be deleted except for LoginRoutes in your production application as
they are all examples.  While LoginRoutes is an example as well, you most likely want a way to login so you would keep
the LoginRoutes module.</p>

<p>Finally, boot up your DevelopmentServer.java main class and open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/helloworld
or go to https://localhost:8443/helloworld to showcase both http and https traffic.</p>

<p>Congratulations on your first webpieces page -- next we will make our html a bit more dynamic.</p>

<h2>A Walkthrough of the generated Server.java</h2>

<p>When you start up DevelopmentServer.java, most changes to your web application will not require a restart.  Because
webpieces is a library, however, changes to the 3 classes that startup webpieces would require a restart and they are</p>

<ol>
   <li>Server.java</li>
   <li>ServerConfig.java</li>
   <li>WebSSLFactory.java</li>
</ol>

<p>YOU own these classes now to modify to your heart's content.  Any changes to these classes or classes 
that these depend on would require a development server restart to see the changes. Luckily, these
classes pretty much do not really need to ever be touched.</p>

<p>Looking closer at Server.java, you will notice 3 different configurations</p>

<ol>
   <li>WebServerConfig</li>
   <li>RouterConfig</li>
   <li>TemplateConfig</li>
</ol>

<p>Each config object configures that piece of the webserver making it easier to trace what different configurations do
as well as keep each piece separate from each other.</p>  

<p>We have a firm belief that nearly all properties should be in the database and not on the filesystem including 
configuration properties.  We generate Server.java such that you could modify it and put any properties 
you like on the filesystem but we advise against 99% of properties there as typically you want property file 
changes to go through your test team rather than someone getting on a production server and tweaking a property.
Of course, the 1 property that must be a command line argument or a property is the database connection such that
your server can exist in multiple environments like development, staging, and production with different database
connections.</p>  

<p>To make it simpler for all components/plugins to read/write properties into a database, an interface SimpleStorage.java
is provided.  The generated application implements this interface connecting it to hibernate but you could change it
to connect to some noSQL database or whatever else you would like.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: In the future, we want to add a bean plugin that exposes MBeans to a web gui for you and also 
saves changes to the database thereby eliminating the need for property files for basically everything. It would
do the following for you...</b></p>

<ol>
   <li>expose a web page dynamically to modify those properties(for one node or for all machines)</li>
   <li>read in the properties from SimpleStorage on startup to set them back to what they were</li>
   <li>write changes from the web page into the database so they are persisted</li>
</ol>

<p>This automatically managed way of doing properties is preferred over using property files</p>

<h2>A walkthrough of Meta & Modules & Plugins</h2>

<p>The main bootstrap file that webpieces webserver reads in is {yourproject}-all/{yourproject}/src/main/resources/appmeta.txt
for production mode and {yourproject}-all/{yourproject}/src/main/resources/appmeta-dev.txt for Development mode.  This
file boostraps your web application by telling us your meta file.</p>  

<p>If you look closely, you will notice the appmeta-dev.txt contains DeveloperMeta.java and in that file, he just re-uses all
the production meta stuff as well as adding 2 plugins that are only in the development server.  After all, we don't
want to expose a SQL GUI nor webpieces documentation on our production website.</p>

<p>Next, looking at {yourproject}Meta.java file, you will notice it is broken down into 3 main components</p>

<ol>
   <li>list of Guice Modules</li>
   <li>list of Route Modules</li>
   <li>list of Plugins</li>
</ol>

<p>I won't go in depth on plugins at this point but just note that plugins can be another fully contained web
application with it's own guice modules, route modules, controllers, and html pages.  This allows you to plugin
full webapplications into your webapplication.  It's what we use for all the backend plugins that could be removed
if you desire a really thin lightweight server</p>
