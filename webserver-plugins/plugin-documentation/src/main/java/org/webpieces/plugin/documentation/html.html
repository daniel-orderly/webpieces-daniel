<h1 id="html">Html Form Input</h1>

<p>Webpieces keeps you, the developer, very close to the original low level html.  It tries to stay away from generating
html(unlike jsp and higher level languages).  We do this as there is then less to learn and generally less bugs since we
are not creating a bunch of html generation code.  All of the examples of this page could be figured out from the template
reference documentation, but this helps jump start your development so you can do a bunch of copy & pasting from this page</p>

<p>In the Helloworld example tutorial, you should have already seen usage of the form html element to create 
forms.  All of the below either go within the webpieces *[#{form}#]* tag or a generic html *[<form>]* element.  It is
better to use the webpieces tag since that will verify the urls still exist when building so you don't deploy a 
webapp with broken urls, however, we do not prevent you from using an  html *[<form>]* element in case you really
need to.</p>

<p>All the below examples use the webpieces *[#{form}#]* tag</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="@[INPUT_TEXT]@">*[<input type="text"> or <input type="password">]*</a></li>
    <li><a href="@[CHECKBOX]@">*[<input type="checkbox">]*</a></li>
    <li><a href="@[ENUM_LIST_SINGLE_SELECT]@">*[<select>]* with enum (single selection)</a></li>
    	
	*{
    <li><a href="#enum2">*[<select>]* with enum (multi-select)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#radio">*[<input type="radio">]*</a></li>
    }*
</ol>
