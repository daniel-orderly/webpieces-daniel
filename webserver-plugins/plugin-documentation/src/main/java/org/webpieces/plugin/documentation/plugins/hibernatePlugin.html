<h3>Hibernate Plugin</h3>

<p>This is a production plugin that brings in the use of hibernate.  The plugin leverages the EntityLookup 
extension point of webpieces so that webpieces can lookup the entity for you and then overwrite all the
modifications when a user edits some form on a webpage.  The plugin is also easily removable from
the default generated webpieces template by modifying the build.gradle file to not bring in the plugin
jar file.  After that, just remove code that doesn't compile and the plugin is gone!</p>
