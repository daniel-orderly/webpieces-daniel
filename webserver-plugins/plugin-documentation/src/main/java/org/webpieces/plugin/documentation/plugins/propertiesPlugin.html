<h3>Properties Plugin</h3>

<p><b>Does not exist but will be Siiiiiiick when it does</b></p>

<p>Ok, imagine a world where you extend any one of your Guice classes with XXXXMBean.  Then, as the
server starts up, we add a jdk proxy to that bean which does 2 things:</p>

<ol>
    <li>It exposes a webpage exposing all set/get methods to a webpage for you to modify</li>
    <li>The proxy saves any changes to a database</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, any time you go into this backend plugin and submit changes, we save it to a database
for you(in case you restart the server) AND we apply the changes to your class which may or 
may not have an immediate effect depending on how you code it.  Then, when you restart the server,
we also read in from the database and re-apply all your changes so they are persistent.</p>

<p>Basically say goodbye to property files forever!!! They are not needed and in fact with property
files you need an F'ing restart.  How stupid.  Let the magic that is webpieces do the work 
for you</p>
