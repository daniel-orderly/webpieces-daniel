<h3>H2 Plugin</h3>

<p>When first creating a webpieces template, we actually install this plugin in the production server
so you can see webpieces in action right away.  We actually suggest you modify the build files to not
bring it into the production server and then modify the {project}-dev build.gradle file to bring it
into the development server instead.  Once you do that, you should get compiler errors in your
XXXXXMeta.java file and you can copy that code to your DeveloperMeta.java file instead so the 
plugin is brought into only your development server.</p>
