<h3>Install SSL Plugin</h3>

<p>This plugin kicks ass.  It is a production plugin.  You login to the backend plugin to access this plugin
and then go through a wizard to install a free SSL cert, but better yet, doing this on just ONE server
in your cluster of webpieces webservers installs it on all N servers where N could be 1000 servers.
It is as simple as that.</p>
